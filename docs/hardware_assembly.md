## Qwiic Assembly

Since this is a Qwiic board, assembling it into a circuit is easy. Just connect the Qwiic ADC to a Qwiic-enabled development board using a Qwiic connector. From there, you'll obviously need some analog inputs to convert so for a quick demo we've set up a simple circuit to measure output from a flex sensor. Head back to the [Quick Start Guide](./quick_start.md) for instructions on how to set up the flex sensor demo circuit.
