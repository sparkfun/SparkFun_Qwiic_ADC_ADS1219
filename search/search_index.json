The other side of the board has a pair of 6-pin PTH headers. The outer header includes the ADS1219's four analog inputs as well as the positive and negative external reference voltage inputs. The inner header breaks out the ADS1219's analog voltage input (VDDA) along with five ground pins for the analog inputs and analog voltage input.

Open this jumper to disable the power LED.</li> <li>I<sup>2</sup>C - The I<sup>2</sup>C jumper pulls the SDA and SCL signals to 3.3V through a pair of 2.2K\u03a9 resistors. Open the three-way jumper completely to remove the pull-ups from the bus if needed. <li>3V3-VDDA  - The 3V3-VDDA jumper nets the ADS1219's digital and analog supply voltages together to both operate at 3.3V and is CLOSED by default. Open this jumper to isolate the two voltages if you're supplying separate voltages for the analog and digital supplies.</li> <p>The other eight jumpers control the ADS1219's I<sup>2</sup>C address and are grouped into labels A1 and A0. Each group has solder jumpers labeled G (Ground), V (3.3V), D (SDA) and C (SCL). By default, the board connects both A1 and A0 to Ground and sets the address to 0x40.
